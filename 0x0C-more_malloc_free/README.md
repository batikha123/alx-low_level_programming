##In this project 0x0B. C we will be taking a look at dynamic memory allocation in c:
##	Using malloc, calloc, realloc and free as well as exit
##	In solving the following tasks:

##	Mandatory:
	
	0. Trust no one
	1. string_nconcat
	2. _calloc
	3. array_range

##	Advanced:

	4. _realloc
	5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope

## Check 'main.h' for functions prototypes!
